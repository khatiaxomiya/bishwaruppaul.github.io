###Hi! My name is Bishwarup Paul.

<br>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Department of Biological Sciences, IISER-Kolkata. I study ants, and try to understand various aspects of these fascinating creatures. 

<br>

I did my Bachelor's in Microbiology. But after I experienced the amazing world of ants and the interest behind studying and understanding them, there was no stopping me. 

<br>

I am a restless person, and get bored very easily. To stop this from happening, I keep myself busy in a lot of things. To know more about me, keep reading!
